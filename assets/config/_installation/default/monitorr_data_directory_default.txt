Monitorr data directory
https://github.com/Monitorr/Monitorr


- This directory and files within are components of the Monitorr web application. 
- These files should NOT be edited manually. 
- In case of corruption, these files can be regenerated using the Monitorr settings page which is located in the local monitorr repo at /settings.php
- If the settings page is not accessible, you can also attempt to browse to /<monitorr repo location>/assets/config/_installation/_register.php
- If the credentials to the settings page need to be changed or reset, rename the file in this directory users.db to 'users.old' and the file in the local monitorr at <monitorr repo location>/assets/config/datadir.json. Once both of those files are renamed, browse to the Monitorr settings page again to establish a new data directory and user database.  NOTE, this process will NOT overwrite your current settings, however will create an additional data directory with the default values.  If you want to establish a new user database but keep your old settings, simply create a new data directory, establish user credentials, then copy the 3 .json files from the OLD data directory to the new data directory.  Once this is completed, you can remove the old data directory.
